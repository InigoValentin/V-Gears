## Run the engine

If you have followed the [build](BUILD.md "Building guide") and [installaton](INSTALL.md "Installation guide") guides, you'll have the game data installed to `~/.v-gears/`, and the binaries compilled somewhere (we'll assum they are in `~/V-Gears/build/bin`, change the directories according to your system).

On a terminal, do into the game data folder, and from there, run the engine

```Bash
cd ~/.v-gears/;
~/V-Gears/build/bin/v-gears;

```
