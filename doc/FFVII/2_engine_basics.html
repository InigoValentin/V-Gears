        <h2>The Engine Basics</h2>
        <h3>Parts of the Engine</h3>
        <p>
            The engine used to power Final Fantasy 7 is split into several
            modules. This allowed the programming team to break apart into very
            distinct groups. It also created a very diverse game playing
            environment. It also allowed the artists to only have to work
            within their own module, keeping the artwork as dynamic as
            possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            The module system allowed for a single point of entry into, and
            exit out of, each distinct part of the game. The PSX, which the
            game was originally developed for, had very limited resources. With
            only 1 megabyte of video ram and 2 megabytes of system ram, data
            had to be banked in and out efficiently. Modules were a clean way
            to dump whole parts of the engine to make way for other parts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The core system is made up of six modules. They are called the
            kernel, field, menu, world map, battle, and mini game. They are
            arranged in the following order.

        <h3>Generic Program Flow</h3>
        <p>
            Not every module is accessible by every other module. There is a
            distinct flow between them. For example, you can not access the
            menu from battle, much to the chagrin of the poor user who had
            forgotten to equip some last minute item. The field module, second
            only to the kernel, drives the game. It includes a powerful
            scripting system that can call any module within the game.
