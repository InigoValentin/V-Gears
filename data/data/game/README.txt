This directory is intentionally empty. It will be populated by the data installer.

Once the data installation is complete, several Lua scripts with static game data will be
installed here. Those scripts only define game constants and settings, and are not to be written
during a normal playthrough. If you are a modder, those scripts are a good place to start.
