This directory is intentionally empty. It will be populated by the data installer.

Once the data installation is complete, character portraits will be installed here, named after
the character IDs. If you are a modder, it's perfectly fine to edit them as you see fit, but try
to keep their aspect ratio. If changed, menu screens, and probably some other things, will need to
be revised.
