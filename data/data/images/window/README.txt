This directory is intentionally empty. It will be populated by the data installer.

Once the data installation is complete, several images used for window decorations will be
installed here. If you are a modder, it's perfectly fine to edit them as you see fit, but try to
keep their size and names intact. If changed, menu screens, and probably some other things, will
need to be revised.
