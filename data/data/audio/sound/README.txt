This directory is intentionally empty. It will be populated by the data installer.

Once the data installation is complete, sound files will be installed here. They will have very
un-descriptive file names, and there is no metadata in them, such as titles. But, if you want to
find a specific one, a looc at the file data/sounds.xml (also generated by the installer) may help
you. There, some files in this folder may be referenced by a friendlier name.
