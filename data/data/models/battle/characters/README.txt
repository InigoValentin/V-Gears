This directory is intentionally empty. It will be populated by the data installer.

Once the data installation is complete, a lot of files will be installed here. They contain
information about 3D models and textures for the battle playable characters. Most of them will have
very cryptic names. If you are a modder and want to manually edit the 3D models, I have a few
pointers for you:

 1. Good luck.
 2. Make backups.
 3. Document everything! If you are succesfull, I would love to know how you did it.
